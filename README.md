## *User Story*
AS a musical connoisseur and a fan of Kanye West, 
\
**I WANT** to have a website with a music player that also gives me quotes from Kanye West.
\
**SO THAT** 
I can enjoy music while also getting inspiration from Kanye.

## *Acceptance Criteria*
*WHEN* a user visits the site,\
*THEN* they can play music.\
*WHEN* the user clicks on the 'Kanye Qoute and Chill' button, \
*THEN* they are shown a philosophical quote from Kanye.\
*WHEN* the user clicks both of these buttons,\
*THEN* they are both smarter and chiller.
